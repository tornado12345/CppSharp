* Fix FieldToProperty pass to ignore non-public properties in C++ generator

* Fix declaration access for generated fields flattened from anonymous types

* Change standard type maps to be more specific about its supported generators

* Generate forward ref header for enum defined inside a class in C++/CLI (#1322) - Ali Alamiri

* Fix GetterSetterToProperty pass heuristic to also detect “on” as a verb

* CppTypePrinter now takes a BindingContext for further usage in type maps handling

* Only generate “override” in header files for C++ generator

* Guard MoveFunctionToClassPass pass registration against CLI and C# generators

* Ignore generated field method acessors when processing properties in GetterSetterToProperty

* Add cli namespace to header to ensure the array type does not conflict with other types called array - Ali Alamiri

* Marshal non primitive fixed arrays (#1311) - Ali Alamiri

* Ensure typedefs of std::vector are mapped - Ali Alamiri

* Simplify the structure of the LLVM package

* Always keep default constructors in the AST
